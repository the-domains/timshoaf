Had an amazing trip with my brothers and cousins! Absolutely beautiful country out near Bend, OR. All of this would not be possible if it weren't for the love and sponser of our Grandfather, Jim. Thank you all so much for helping drag my spherical computer nerd body up the rock to help form this truly wonderful memory!
